;;; Commentary:
;; `recentf' is an Emacs package that maintains a list of recently
;; accessed files, making it easier to reopen files you have worked on
;; recently.

;;; Code:


(use-package recentf
  :ensure nil
  :demand t
  :config
  (setopt recentf-save-file (expand-file-name "recentf" user-emacs-directory)
          recentf-max-saved-items nil
          recentf-max-menu-items 100
          recentf-auto-cleanup 10
          recentf-exclude '("\\.git.*"))

  (recentf-mode t))

;;; recentf.el ends here
