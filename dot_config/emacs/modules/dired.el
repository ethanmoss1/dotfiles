;;; Commentary:
;; Directory Editor

;; Dired makes an Emacs buffer containing a listing of a directory,
;; and optionally some of its subdirectories as well.  You can use the
;; normal Emacs commands to move around in this buffer, and special Dired
;; commands to operate on the listed files.  Dired works with both local and
;; remote directories.

;; TODO: Emacs 30 has a setting to not trash on remote sessions. need to set
;; that up.

;; Thanks to;
