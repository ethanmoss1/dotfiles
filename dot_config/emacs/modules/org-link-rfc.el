;;; Commentary:

;; Using org links library, allow for easy adding of RFCâ€™s that link to the
;; website

;; TODO: Move to a buffer version of the RFC, as they are only text.
;; TODO: error handling on the RFC number in the open command
;; TODO: do the export, store and any other parameters required for org links


;;; Code:
(use-package emacs
  :ensure nil
  :after org
  :config
  (org-link-set-parameters "rfc"
                           :follow #'org-rfc-open)

  ;; Functions for RFC links
  (defun org-rfc-open (rfc-num)
    "The RFC that we want to view"
    (browse-url (format "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc%s"
