  ;; Cursor
  ;; The blinking cursor is distracting and interferes with cursor settings in
  ;; some minor modes that try to change it buffer-locally (e.g., Treemacs).
  ;; Additionally, it can cause freezing, especially on macOS, for users with
  ;; customized and colored cursors.
  (blink-cursor-mode -1)

  ;; Don't stretch the cursor to fit wide characters, it is disorienting,
  ;; especially for tabs.

  ;; If enabled and `truncate-lines' is disabled, soft wrapping will not occur

  ;; characters.

  ;; Prefer spaces over tabs. Spaces offer a more consistent default compared to
  ;; 8-space tabs. This setting can be adjusted on a per-mode basis as needed.

  ;; Enable indentation and completion using the TAB key
  (setq-default tab-always-indent nil)

  ;; Enable multi-line commenting which ensures that `comment-indent-new-line'
  ;; properly continues comments onto new lines, which is useful for writing
  ;; longer comments or docstrings that span multiple lines.
