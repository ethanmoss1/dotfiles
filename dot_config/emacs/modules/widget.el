;;; Commentary:
;; Emacs ui customisation

;; Most graphical user interface toolkits provide a number of standard
;; userinterface controls (sometimes known as “widgets” or “gadgets”).  Emacs
;; doesn’t really support anything like this, except for an incredibly powerful
;; text “widget”.  On the other hand, Emacs does provide the necessary
;; primitives to implement many other widgets within a text buffer.  The
;; ‘widget’ package simplifies this task.

;;; Code:
(use-package widget
  :ensure nil
  :config
  ;; No ugly button for checkboxes
  (setq widget-image-enable nil))

(provide 'widget)
;;; widget.el ends here
