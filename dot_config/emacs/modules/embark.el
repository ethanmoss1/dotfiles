;;; Code:

(use-package embark
  :bind
  (("C-," . embark-act)         ;; pick some comfortable binding
   ("M-." . embark-dwim)        ;; good alternative: M-.
   ("C-h B" . embark-bindings)) ;; alternative for `describe-bindings'

  :init
  ;; Optionally replace the key help with a completing-read interface
  (setopt prefix-help-command #'embark-prefix-help-command)

  ;; Show the Embark target at point via Eldoc. You may adjust the
  ;; Eldoc strategy, if you want to see the documentation from
  ;; multiple providers. Beware that using this can be a little
  ;; jarring since the message shown in the minibuffer can be more
  ;; than one line, causing the modeline to move up and down:

  ;; (add-hook 'eldoc-documentation-functions #'embark-eldoc-first-target)
  ;; (setq eldoc-documentation-strategy #'eldoc-documentation-compose-eagerly)

  :config
  ;; Hide the mode line of the Embark live/completions buffers
  (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
               '("\\`\\*Embark Collect \\(Live\\|Completions\\)\\*"
                 nil
                 (window-parameters (mode-line-format . none)))))
