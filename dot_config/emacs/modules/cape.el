;;; Code:

(use-package cape
  ;; Bind prefix keymap providing all Cape commands under a mnemonic key.
  ;; Press C-c p ? to for help.
  ;; :bind ("C-c p" . cape-prefix-map) ;; Alternative key: M-<tab>, M-p, M-+
  ;; Alternatively bind Cape commands individually.
  ;; :bind (("C-c p d" . cape-dabbrev)
  ;;        ("C-c p h" . cape-history)
  ;;        ("C-c p f" . cape-file)
  ;;        ...)
  :init
  ;; Add to the global default value of `completion-at-point-functions' which is
  ;; used by `completion-at-point'.  The order of the functions matters, the
  ;; first function returning a result wins.  Note that the list of buffer-local
  ;; completion functions takes precedence over the global list.
  ;; see above commentary for more available Capfs
