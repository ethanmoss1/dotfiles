;; Modifying Window function that aren't written in C.

;;; Code:

(use-package window
  :ensure nil
  :config
  ;; Respect display actions specified. eg, in ‘display-buffer-alist’
  (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t)
  (setq switch-to-buffer-in-dedicated-window 'pop)
  (setq display-buffer-base-action '(nil))  ; default

  (setq split-width-threshold 170
		split-height-threshold nil)

  ;; resizing windows
  (setq window-resize-pixelwise nil
		resize-mini-windows 'grow-only)

  ;; Window divider on EXWM
  (if (string= my-hostname "laptop")
      (add-hook 'elpaca-after-init-hook window-divider-mode))
  ;; and its settings
  (setq window-divider-default-places t
		window-divider-default-right-width 2
		window-divider-default-bottom-width 2)

  ;; helper to make a window a dedicated one.
  (defun my/make-window-dedicated-toggle ()
    "Toggles the selected window, making it dedicated."
    (interactive)
    (let ((is-dedicated (window-dedicated-p (selected-window))))
	  (set-window-dedicated-p (selected-window) (not is-dedicated))
	  (message "Window dedicated: %s" (not is-dedicated))))

  (defun my/reset-frame-window-state ()
    "For when experementing with window states."
    (interactive)
    (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'window-state nil)))
