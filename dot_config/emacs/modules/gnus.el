		;; dont use the newsrc file, i only use gnus
		gnus-save-newsrc-file 'nil
		gnus-read-newsrc-file 'nil))

;; One thing to note, for some reason when adding devnull, it only works on
;; http. this may be an issue for the future. if that is the case modifying the
;; ‘nnatom--read-feed’ function on the line;
;;
;; (mm-url-insert-file-contents (concat "https://" feed)))
;;
;; replacing https with http will allow for adding the feed in this instance
