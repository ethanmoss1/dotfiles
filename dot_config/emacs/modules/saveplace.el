;;; Commentary:
;; `save-place-mode` enables Emacs to remember the last location within a file
;; upon reopening. This feature is particularly beneficial for resuming work at
;; the precise point where you previously left off.

;;; Code:
(use-package saveplace
  :ensure nil
  :config
  (setq save-place-file (expand-file-name "cache/saveplace" user-emacs-directory)
		save-place-limit 800)
  (save-place-mode t))

;;; saveplace.el ends here
