  ;; (corfu-cycle t)                ;; Enable cycling for `corfu-next/previous'
  (corfu-auto t)                 ;; Enable auto completion
  (corfu-separator ?\s)          ;; Orderless field separator

  ;;        (eshell-mode . corfu-mode))

  ;; Recommended: Enable Corfu globally.  This is recommended since Dabbrev can
  ;; be used globally (M-/).  See also the customization variable
  ;; `global-corfu-modes' to exclude certain modes.

;; Additional package to make it work on terminal.

;; A few more useful configurations...
(use-package emacs
  :ensure nil
  :init
  ;; TAB cycle if there are only few candidates
  (setq completion-cycle-threshold 3)

  ;; Emacs 28: Hide commands in M-x which do not apply to the current mode.
  ;; Corfu commands are hidden, since they are not supposed to be used via M-x.
  ;; (setq read-extended-command-predicate
  ;;       #'command-completion-default-include-p)

  ;; Enable indentation+completion using the TAB key.
  ;; `completion-at-point' is often bound to M-TAB.
